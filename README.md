Data Warehousing: Established a MySQL database to store the downloaded data securely and efficiently.
Data Modeling: Designed and implemented relational tables within the MySQL database to structure the Netflix data.
Data Cleaning: Performed data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality for analysis. This may have involved handling missing values, inconsistencies, or formatting issues.
Data Analysis: Addressed five specific business questions through data analysis. These questions likely focused on aspects like content trends, genre popularity, or release year distribution. (Mention the specific questions you analyzed if possible)
